# TITLE
README.GENERATOR

## Description
This is a README generator that was assigned to me in class. The idea behind the project is that all projects need a README but, not every body has a good template nor starting point for their README. This also a project to test my ablities with node.js. Can I make a command line based application that takes user input and over lays it onto an optimized README template.

## Usage
First you go into command line and run the application using 'node index.js' (don't forget to install!). Afterwards answer the questions to the best of your abilities. Once you are done with all that you should your very own README file.

## Made with
Javascript
Node.js
Markdown
NPM 
inquirer
